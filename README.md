**Assistant Researcher and Systems Engineer** | He/Him | B.Sc. (Hons.) Computer Science, (graduating Spring 2026)

# 👋 Hi, I'm Ryan Boothby-Young

I'm a Computer Science Honours student and research assistant at Vancouver Island University, specializing in **distributed systems, operating systems, and concurrent programming**.
I enjoy building systems that solve **real-world financial problems** under complexity and constraint.

## 🧠 My Focus Areas
- ⚙️ High-performance systems engineering (multithreading, concurrency, low-latency)
- 🌐 Distributed systems and simulation
- 💸 Financial modeling and algorithmic trading infrastructure
- 🤖 AI/ML (supporting role in larger systems)

## 🔧 Notable Projects

### 🪙 [Crypto Index Fund Simulator]
> A multithreaded portfolio simulator where each asset is represented by a thread. Models real-world rebalancing inefficiencies due to data staleness, race conditions, and thread contention.

- Thread-safe state logic and rebalancing mechanisms
- Simulates cap-weighted portfolios under volatility
- Demonstrates concurrency challenges in financial systems

### ⚡ [Matching Engine + Exchange Simulator (WIP)]
> A high-performance matching engine built in Rust/C++ with FIX-style order support and backtesting capabilities.

- Sub-millisecond limit order matching
- Real-time pub-sub architecture with Redis or Kafka
- Supports distributed simulation of market behavior

---

## 📚 Currently Learning
- Advanced Rust and lock-free concurrency patterns
- Market microstructure and HFT systems
- Low-latency systems benchmarking and profiling

---

## 💼 Looking For
> I'm open to new grad roles or internships in:
- Quant/Algo Infrastructure
- Distributed Systems Engineering
- FinTech Platform or Trading Systems Engineering

I'm open to relocating to major tech or finance hubs: **Toronto, New York, London, Amsterdam, Chicago**.
