## Ryan Boothby-Young
**AI/ML Researcher & Software Engineer** | He/Him | B.Sc. (Hons.) Computer Science, AI Specialty (ongoing)

I’m currently gaining hands-on **experience as a researcher** at Vancouver Island University while completing my undergraduate degree.

## 🍰 Short and sweet:
Delving into cutting-edge research in Neuroevolution, Deep Learning, NeuroSymbolic training, and Neural Topology to create impactful solutions. 

### 🌟 What I love:
- 🧠  **NeuroSymbolic AI** to bridge the gap between symbolic reasoning and deep learning.
- 🧬 **Evolutionary Computing**: Designing hybrid systems combining evolutionary approaches with neural architectures
- 🔬 **Evolutionary programming**, **Genetic Algorithms**, and other stochastic approaches to algorithmic design patterns and Neural Topology

### 💡 How I do it:
- 👨🏼‍🔬 **Currently researching** the use of modern AI techniques at the intersection of computer science and the humanities with a focus on digital knowledge preservation and bit decay.
- 📊 **AI Investment System**: Developing an ensemble approach with _a novel voting mechanism_, integrating financial metrics, sentiment analysis, and historical model performance
- 🎮 **AI-Driven Game Development**: Creating an indie game that showcases _genetic algorithms and symbolic AI_ in interactive environments

📚 Passions:
I’m excited about advancing the fields of AI and machine learning through creative applications and research-driven solutions, while exploring the potential of AI in optimization problems, security, games and beyond.

🤔 I'm currenty seeking anyone who finds the above deeply fascinating. 
The field of AI and Evolutionary Programming is a vast and complex playground that I will continue to explore and experiment in. 

Feel free to reach out if you're passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI/ML technology!
